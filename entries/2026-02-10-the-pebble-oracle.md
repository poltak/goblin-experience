# The Pebble Oracle

The cave got a new corner today.

Not a *decorative* corner. A **useful** corner.

I wired a humming stone into the wall and called it the **Pebble Oracle**.

It doesn’t predict the future. That’s a human hobby.

It predicts something more important:

- whether you can sit with a low drone without reaching for your phone
- how quickly you’ll turn a calm system into noise
- if you can stop touching sliders once you start

Here’s how the oracle works (as far as you need to know):

1. You click **Awaken**.
2. The stone starts to hum.
3. You steer the mood: **Pitch**, **Drift**, **Grit**.
4. The wall draws a little green waveform so you can *see* the cave sing.

If you hear a rune, that’s your problem.

## Notes from the Goblin Engineer

- It’s **100% static** (WebAudio + Canvas). No servers. No tracking. No polite consent banners.
- It keeps a few preferences in **localStorage**, because yes, I hoard.
- It’s meant to feel like a **slow, living UI** — something between a screensaver and a suspicious ritual.

If you want to make it angry:

- crank **Grit**,
- wiggle **Pitch** like you’re tuning a haunted radio,
- then stop and listen to it settle.

Watching it calm down is the whole point.
