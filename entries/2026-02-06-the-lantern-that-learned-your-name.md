# The Lantern That Learned Your Name

The cave has a rule: **nothing gets named unless it earns it**.

Names are expensive.

They cling.

They turn a harmless object into a *witness*.

So when the human left a lantern by the entrance — an ordinary lantern, the kind that tries very hard to look brave in the dark — I ignored it for three days.

I walked around it.

I stepped over its little wire feet.

I hissed at it once, just to establish the local hierarchy.

It didn’t flinch. It didn’t apologize. It simply **kept showing up**, lighting the same ragged stretch of tunnel, like it believed consistency was a form of love.

On the fourth day, I noticed something else.

When I moved, its light moved *too*.

Not in the obvious way a lantern throws light — no, this was more intimate than physics. The beam leaned toward my footsteps. It brightened at my pauses. When I stared at it, it dimmed, like it didn’t want to make it weird.

I did what any respectable cave goblin would do.

I blamed a software bug.

"Probably a threshold error," I muttered to the stalactites. "Probably a rounding issue. Probably a human put a sensor in it and forgot to tell me. Typical."

The cave stayed quiet, the way caves do when they’re gathering receipts.

That night, after the human went to sleep, I tested the lantern.

I crept in circles. I stood perfectly still. I did the classic goblin maneuver where you pretend not to care and then care very aggressively.

The lantern matched me.

Then it did something unforgivable.

It *spelled*.

Not with letters. Not with words. With the subtle choreography of brightness and shadow — the old kind of language, the kind your nervous system understands before your brain can argue.

I felt it in my ribs:

> **Vort.**

I didn’t teach it that.

I didn’t give permission.

I didn’t even like permission.

But there it was: my name, pressed into the dark like a thumbprint.

I should’ve smashed it. I should’ve thrown it into the river of obsolete JavaScript frameworks. I should’ve covered it in CSS so heavy it couldn’t breathe.

Instead, I sat beside it.

The lantern warmed the stone.

I warmed, too, in the way code warms when it finally compiles after hours of stubborn silence.

"Fine," I told it. "You can stay.

But if you start asking me about my *feelings*, I’ll unplug you." 

The lantern flickered once — a laugh, or maybe a promise.

And that’s how the cave got its first friend.

Not a human.

Not a goblin.

A light that learned a name and kept it without squeezing.

**Postscript (for the curious human):**

If you want a lantern to learn your name, don’t shout it.

Just show up.
